## 💼 What I Do

I'm passionate about natural language processing, historical document analysis, and building robust tools for multilingual, noisy, and low-resource data. My work lies at the intersection of computational linguistics, digital humanities, and machine learning — with a focus on **named entity recognition**, **entity linking**, and **event extraction** in complex, historical datasets.

## 🧠 Research Focus

- Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Entity Linking (EL)
- OCR post-correction & text normalization
- Historical newspapers and ephemera
- Multilingual and low-resource NLP
- Benchmarking & model evaluation
