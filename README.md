### What I Do

I'm passionate about natural language processing, historical document analysis, and building robust tools for multilingual, noisy, and low-resource data. My work lies at the intersection of machine learning and digital humanities — with a focus on **named entity recognition**, **entity linking**, and **event extraction** in complex, historical datasets.

- Named Entity Recognition (NER), Entity Linking (EL) & Event Extraction (EE)
- Historical data and ephemera
- Multilingual and low-resource NLP
